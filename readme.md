Traffic Estimation Using Open Data
================

***THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS***

This is a short research project with the aim of exploring the potential
of two elements for network-wide traffic estimation in the area of Hull:

- the use of an open dataset as the main source of traffic data for the
  estimation model,
- and the implementation of a Bayesian model to produce an estimation of
  traffic across the network.

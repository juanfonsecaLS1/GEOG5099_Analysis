Where:

- $T$ is the traffic flow on a minor road,
- $P$ is the population living along the minor road,
- $E$ employees and working owners along the minor road,
- $V$ the cars available along the minor road, 
- $M$ the traffic flow of the nearest major road with observed traffic, 
- $J$ the distance to the nearest minor-major road junction, 
- $D$ the road density in the LSOA where the minor road is located, and 
- $C$ is the standardised centrality of the minor road link.

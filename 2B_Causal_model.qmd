```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.dim=c(3,3)}
library(dagitty)
library(ggdag)

dag_traffic <- dagitty("dag {
C -> T
D -> C
D -> T
E -> T
J -> T
M -> T
P -> E
P -> T
P -> V
V -> T
}
")

ggdag(dag_traffic) + theme_dag_blank()
```

Where:

$T$ is the traffic flow on a minor road, $P$ is the population living along the minor road, $E$ employees and working owners along the minor road, $V$ the cars available along the minor road, $M$ the traffic flow on the nearest major road, $J$ the distance to the nearest minor-major road junction, $D$ the road density in the LSOA where the minor road is located, and $C$ is the standardised centrality of the minor road link.

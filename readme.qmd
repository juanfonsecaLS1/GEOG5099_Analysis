***THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS***

This is a short research project with the aim of exploring the potential of two elements for network-wide traffic estimation in the area of Hull:

-   the use of an open dataset as the main source of traffic data for the estimation model,
-   and the implementation of a Bayesian model to produce an estimation of traffic across the network.
